# DeadMaze is here!
As a Project to demonstrate AI, we created a simple game showcasing how far pathfinding has gotten. The game 
demonstrates the A* algorithm being used by enemies to track a player throughout a huge maze with minimal effort!

## Gameplay
You are the last human alive and are stuck in a maze with no entrance or exit... odd. But you have no time to
think about how you got here, all you know is: You must survive! Equipped with only an AK-47 and a lantern in the 
dead of night, you must fend off hoardes of zombies coming your way... and they are hungry! Your lantern is a life-saver,
since you can't see without it in this devastatingly dark night, but its range is limited! The occasional lightning strike
may aid you though, as it illuminates the entire playing field for you...

## Controls
WASD -> Movement
Mouse movement -> look around
Rightclick -> aim down gun (will slow you down)
Leftclick -> shoot (You must aim your gun first)
Shift -> sprint

Shooting and sprinting takes up your stamina, so make sure you use these abilities wisely!
